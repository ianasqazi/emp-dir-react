# **REACT-EMPLOYEE-DIRECTORY**


An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## USER STORY 

> AS AN avid traveller
> I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a internet connection
> SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling

> AS A user, 
> I WANT to be able to view my entire employee directory at once 
> SO THAT I have quick access to their information.

### NPM Packages

- REACT
- REACT-DOM
- REACT-SCRIPTS
- AXIOS

## Running the Application

1. Run the following commands in your terminal window 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ianasqazi/employee-directory-react

cd employee-directory-react

npm install
```

<!-- 2. Run the seeder file if running on local machine or app connected on HEROKU - JAWS DB
```bash
node seeders/seed.js
``` -->

All packages will be installed and now run the application with the command below : 

```bash
npm start
```

## REACT

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
